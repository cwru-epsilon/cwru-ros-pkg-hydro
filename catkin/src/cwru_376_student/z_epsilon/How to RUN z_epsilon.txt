In a single Window and BEFORE connecting remotely...
	1) roscore
	2) roslaunch industrial_robot_client robot_interface_download.launch robot_ip:=192.168.0.50
	3) roslaunch cwru_urdf abby_w_arm_rviz.launch
	4) roslaunch cwru_base start_abby_base.launch

After that connect remotly using Reminna...

Then on a new terminal, you can keep running the following
	1) rosrun epsilon_arm irb120_int

Then on a new terminal, start MOTION
	1) roslaunch epsilon_motion epsilon_dead_launcher.launch (keep running)
(IF this method does not succeed, we will use TELEOP)

After arriving in a good spot near the table, first check line of sight from rviz,
close point cloud from rviz, go back to the irb120_int terminal and open a new TAB
	2) rosrun epsilon_arm pcd_saver
After the image is successfully saved, 
keep in the same directory and rather the same terminal
	3) rosrun epsilon_arm can_finder

The job for running new programs is done :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will first choose a good PATCH from rviz on the table. 
Then run the trigger
	rosservice call process_mode 5
Check resulted model in rviz, make sure that it fits perfectly.
Right now the center point above the can is sent to the irb120_int.

Then process our goal point (move the arm towards that point)
	rosservice call move_trigger 1
This will lookup if there are available IK solutions for motion towards our goal point

-------------------------------------
Trigger Service for Arm Gribber HERE
-------------------------------------   

Once grapped the Can and the robot is back to its Transition Pose, Bring IT Home :)
NOTE: It is better to use (rosrun epsilon_motion leave_table) first to back up 0.5m from the table #####
Then :)
	rosservice call move_back 1

THATS IT
THANK YOU :)
